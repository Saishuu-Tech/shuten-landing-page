## 1. Definitions
- "Applicable Data Protection Laws" means data protection and privacy laws applicable to the processing of Customer Personal Data under the Agreement, which may include, as applicable, U.S. state privacy laws (e.g., CCPA/CPRA) and, if elected by Customer or required, GDPR/UK GDPR and related laws.
- "Controller" (or "Business"**) means the entity that determines the purposes and means of processing Customer Personal Data.
- "Processor" (or "Service Provider"**) means the entity that processes Customer Personal Data on behalf of the Controller.
- "Customer Personal Data" means personal data/information processed by Company on behalf of Customer via the Services.
- "Subprocessor" means any processor engaged by Company to process Customer Personal Data on Company’s behalf.

Terms not defined in this DPA have the meanings set forth in the Agreement.

## 2. Scope and Roles
2.1. Company acts as Processor/Service Provider and Customer acts as Controller/Business with respect to Customer Personal Data.

2.2. Subject Matter and Duration. The subject matter of processing is the provision of the Services. Processing will continue for the term of the Agreement and until deletion of Customer Personal Data in accordance with this DPA.

## 3. Instructions
3.1. Company will process Customer Personal Data only on documented instructions from Customer, including as set forth in the Agreement and this DPA, unless required to do so by law. In such case, Company will inform Customer of that legal requirement before processing, unless prohibited by law.

3.2. Company will not sell or share Customer Personal Data as defined under applicable U.S. state privacy laws and will not retain, use, or disclose Customer Personal Data for any purpose other than to provide the Services (including to maintain, secure, support, and improve the Services as permitted by the Agreement) or as otherwise permitted by law.

3.3. De‑Identified, Aggregated, and Synthetic Data (Opt‑out Available). Company may generate and use de‑identified, aggregated, or synthetic datasets derived from Customer Personal Data to operate, secure, and improve the Services, to evaluate and train models used to provide the Services, and to develop new features and services, provided such datasets do not contain personal information. Company will maintain and use de‑identified data only in de‑identified form, implement reasonable safeguards to minimize re‑identification risk, require recipients (including Subprocessors) to do the same, and will not attempt to re‑identify individuals. Company does not sell or share personal information under Applicable Data Protection Laws. Customer may opt out by written notice to privacy@shuten.io; Company will honor opt‑out requests on a go‑forward basis within thirty (30) days. Company may continue to use previously generated de‑identified datasets that do not contain personal information.

3.4. CPRA/US-State Service Provider/Contractor Covenants. Where the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the CPRA, or similar U.S. state privacy laws apply, Company certifies that it understands and will comply with applicable restrictions for service providers/contractors. Company will not: (a) sell or share Customer Personal Data; (b) retain, use, or disclose it for any purpose other than the business purposes of providing the Services or as otherwise permitted by law; (c) retain, use, or disclose it outside the direct business relationship with Customer; or (d) combine it with personal information that Company receives from or on behalf of another customer, except as permitted by law (e.g., to detect or prevent security incidents or fraud, or to improve the quality of the Services in a manner that does not infer characteristics about a consumer). If Company determines it can no longer meet its obligations under applicable law, it will notify Customer without undue delay, and Customer may take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized use.

## 4. Confidentiality and Personnel
Company will ensure that persons authorized to process Customer Personal Data are subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations and receive appropriate data protection and security training.

## 5. Security Measures
Company will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Customer Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, including measures appropriate to the risk such as encryption in transit and at rest (where supported by infrastructure), access controls, least-privilege practices, and logging/monitoring. Additional details about the Services’ security controls may be made available on request.

## 6. Subprocessors
6.1. Authorization. Customer provides general authorization for Company to engage Subprocessors. Company will impose on Subprocessors data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this DPA.

6.2. List and Updates. Company maintains a current list of Subprocessors at https://shuten.io/legal/subprocessors. Company may update the list from time to time. Where required by law or contract, Company will provide notice of a new Subprocessor, and Customer may object on reasonable grounds within fifteen (15) days of notice. If the parties cannot resolve an objection in good faith, Customer may terminate the affected Services, and Company will refund any prepaid, unused fees for the terminated portion.

## 7. International Transfers
Customer Personal Data is stored in the United States by default. Upon Customer request and subject to availability and additional fees, Company may enable storage/replication in other regions supported by its vendors. If the processing of Customer Personal Data involves a transfer to a country without an adequate level of protection under Applicable Data Protection Laws, the parties will implement appropriate safeguards (e.g., the EU Standard Contractual Clauses and UK Addendum). Where applicable, this DPA incorporates by reference the EU SCCs (Module 2) and the UK Addendum as the transfer mechanism between Customer (as data exporter) and Company (as data importer).

SCC/UK Addendum Annexes. If and when Customer elects to process Customer Personal Data subject to EU/UK data protection laws, the parties will populate and attach Annex I (parties and description of processing), Annex II (technical and organizational measures), and Annex III (subprocessors) to the SCCs/UK Addendum, including selections for Clause 9 (general authorization with fifteen (15) days’ notice), Clause 17 and 18 (governing law/forum in an EU Member State, commonly Ireland or the Netherlands), and any other required fields.

## 8. Assistance
Taking into account the nature of processing, Company will assist Customer by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as possible, to fulfill Customer’s obligations to respond to requests from data subjects to exercise their rights under Applicable Data Protection Laws. Company will reasonably assist Customer with data protection impact assessments and consultations with supervisory authorities related to Company’s processing of Customer Personal Data, to the extent required by law.

## 9. Audit and Reports
Upon written request no more than once per 12-month period, or following a Security Incident or regulator request, and subject to reasonable confidentiality and security controls, Company will provide information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with this DPA (e.g., descriptions of controls, independent assessment reports where available) and will allow Customer or an independent auditor bound by confidentiality to conduct an assessment of Company’s processing of Customer Personal Data limited to scope and frequency reasonably necessary and without disrupting operations. Customer is responsible for its audit costs.

## 10. Incident Notification
Company will notify Customer without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach involving Customer Personal Data. Such notice will include information reasonably available to Company at the time, including (as appropriate) the nature of the incident, categories and approximate number of data subjects and records concerned, likely consequences, and measures taken or proposed to address the breach.

## 11. Return and Deletion
Upon termination or expiry of the Agreement, Company will delete Customer Personal Data within thirty (30) days, subject to standard backup cycles (typically ~35 days) unless longer retention is required by law. Upon Customer’s written request made within that period, Company will return a copy of Customer Personal Data before deletion in a commonly used format.

## 12. Liability and Precedence
Each party’s liability under this DPA is subject to the limitations and exclusions of liability in the Agreement. In the event of a conflict between this DPA and the Agreement, this DPA controls with respect to the processing of Customer Personal Data; otherwise, the Agreement controls.
