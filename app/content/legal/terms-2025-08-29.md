# Terms of Service

Effective Date: August 29, 2025

These Terms of Service (**"Terms"**) govern your access to and use of Shuten (**"Service"**), operated by Saishuu, Inc., a Delaware corporation (**"Saishuu"**, **"Company"**, **"we"**, **"us"**, or **"our"**). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

## 1. Eligibility and Accounts
- You must be at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction and able to form a binding contract.
- You are responsible for your account, credentials, and all activity under your account.
- You must provide accurate information and keep it up to date.

## 2. Use of the Service
- You may use the Service only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable laws.
- You must not: (a) reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to access source code; (b) interfere with or disrupt the Service; (c) use the Service to infringe, violate, or misappropriate rights; (d) upload malicious code; (e) attempt to access other users’ data without authorization.
- We may monitor use of the Service to ensure quality, improve the Service, and verify compliance with these Terms.

## 3. Subscriptions, Fees, and Taxes
- If the Service is offered on a paid basis, you agree to pay all fees described at the time of purchase, plus applicable taxes.
- Unless otherwise stated, fees are non-refundable except as required by law or expressly provided in these Terms.
- We may change prices with reasonable notice. Price changes take effect at the next billing cycle after notice.

### Billing and Renewal
- Subscriptions auto-renew for successive terms unless canceled before the current term ends. You may cancel effective at the end of the then-current term.
- Upgrades take effect immediately and may be prorated. Downgrades apply at the next renewal and may result in feature or capacity limits.
- Usage‑based and overage charges are assessed based on the metrics and rates described in your selected plan and/or presented in the console dashboard.
- Except where required by law, all fees are non-refundable and non-creditable once the term begins.

### Payment Processor; Currency; Taxes
- We use Stripe or a similar payment processor to process payments. You authorize us and our processor to charge your payment method for fees, taxes, and any overages.
- Fees are charged in U.S. Dollars (USD). You are responsible for all applicable taxes, duties, and similar assessments, excluding our income taxes.

### Payment Failures and Delinquency
- If a payment attempt fails, your account is immediately placed on notice and you will have 48 hours to resolve the issue. After 48 hours past due, we may throttle your account for up to an additional 72 hours. After that period, we may suspend your account. Suspension may impact the availability or performance of your application(s); you acknowledge and accept this risk.
- If your account remains unpaid for 30 days after the original due date, we may terminate your account. Following termination for non‑payment, we will retain a backup of your data for an additional 30 days, after which it may be deleted and unrecoverable.
- You agree not to initiate chargebacks without first contacting billing@shuten.io to resolve billing issues. Initiating a chargeback constitutes a material breach and may result in immediate suspension or termination. We reserve the right to contest chargebacks and to recover any associated fees and costs.

### Free Tier; Trials; Promotions
- We may offer a free tier with limited features and fair‑use caps as disclosed in the console or your selected plan. We may modify limits, throttle, or discontinue free tier accounts at our discretion.
- Trials: Unless otherwise stated, the trial period is 7 days and applies to the Pro tier. Trials are limited to one per user and one per organization or domain, and are subject to fair‑use caps as disclosed in the console or your selected plan. Trials auto‑convert to a paid subscription at the end of the period unless canceled before expiry. We may verify eligibility and prevent circumvention of trial limitations.

### Billing Disputes
- You must notify us of any good‑faith billing dispute within thirty (30) days of the applicable charge by emailing [billing@shuten.io]. We will investigate and work with you in good faith to resolve the dispute. Your failure to provide timely notice will be deemed acceptance of the charge. This section does not limit your rights where prohibited by law.

## 4. Third‑Party Services and Integrations
- The Service may rely on or integrate with third‑party products or services (**"Third‑Party Services"**). Your use of such Third‑Party Services is subject to their terms and privacy policies.
- We are not responsible for Third‑Party Services and disclaim all liability arising from them.

### Open Source Software
- The Service may include or link to open source components subject to their own licenses. To the extent of any conflict between such licenses and these Terms, the open source licenses govern your use of those components.

## 5. Intellectual Property
- We and our licensors retain all rights, title, and interest in and to the Service, including software, documentation, and content provided by us.
- You retain all rights to content you submit to the Service (**"Customer Content"**). You grant us a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑free license to host, process, transmit, display, and otherwise use Customer Content solely to provide, maintain, secure, troubleshoot, and support the Service, and as otherwise permitted by our Privacy Policy and Data Processing Addendum (if applicable). We do not use Customer Content directly to train machine learning models or for product improvements unrelated to your configured use of the Service.
- You grant us the right to use your name and logo to identify you as a customer, unless you opt out by notifying us at [legal@shuten.io].

### De‑Identified, Aggregated, and Synthetic Data
- By default, we may generate and use de‑identified, aggregated, or synthetic datasets derived from Customer Content to operate, secure, and improve the Service, to evaluate and train models used to provide the Service, and to develop new features and services. Such datasets will not include personal information. We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to minimize the risk of re‑identification and we will not attempt to re‑identify individuals. We do not sell or share personal information.
- Opt‑out: You may opt out of our use of your Customer Content to generate such datasets by contacting [privacy@shuten.io]. We will honor opt‑out requests on a go‑forward basis within 30 days. We may continue to use previously generated de‑identified datasets that do not contain personal information.
- Ownership: As between the parties, Saishuu, Inc. owns de‑identified, aggregated, and synthetic datasets it generates, provided they do not contain personal information or Customer trade secrets.

## 6. Feedback
- If you provide feedback or suggestions, you grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty‑free license to use them without restriction or compensation.

## 7. Confidentiality
- Each party may disclose confidential information to the other. The receiving party will use such information only to fulfill its obligations under these Terms and will protect it using reasonable measures.

Changing a primary data region may require coordination and maintenance windows and may incur additional fees.

## 9. Acceptable Use for AI/ML Features (if applicable)
